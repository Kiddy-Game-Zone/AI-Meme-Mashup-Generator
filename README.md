# AI Meme Mashup Generator 🤪🖼️🔥

Welcome to the **AI Meme Mashup Generator**! Get ready for some laughs as our "AI" attempts to create hilarious and sometimes nonsensical captions by combining two random meme concepts. You be the judge: is the result pure internet gold (🔥) or destined for the digital trash can (🗑️)?

## 😂 About The Game

Ever wondered what happens when "Distracted Boyfriend" meets "This is Fine Dog"? Or when "Expanding Brain" collides with "Woman Yelling at Cat"? This game randomly selects two meme concepts (represented by images) and our sophisticated (not really, it's a fun simulation!) AI generates a unique caption trying to bridge the two. Your job is to vote on its comedic genius (or lack thereof!).

✨ **Prepare for unpredictable meme chaos!** ✨

* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For all core game logic:
    * Random selection of meme data.
    * Simulated AI caption generation using predefined templates and keyword/phrase association.
    * Handling user votes and feedback.
    * Saving and retrieving "fire" memes using `localStorage`.

* **🗂️ More Meme Data:** Continuously expand the database of memes, keywords, and caption generation rules.
* **🎯 Thematic Packs:** Introduce packs of memes (e.g., "Animal Memes," "Retro Memes") for more focused mashups.
